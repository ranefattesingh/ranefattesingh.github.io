I am Fattesingh Rane, my friends call me Sahil. I'm a Software Engineer (Since 2019). I live in India, Goa.

♥️  I love coding and designing solutions. I develop simple applications which may not be useful for everyone. Checkout my [GitHub](https://github.com/ranefattesingh).

👨‍💻 I am a polyglot programmer **(Backend)** and can work in Go, JavaScript, Java & Python comfortably.

🌱 I love learning and exploring new things, currently I am learning **Apache Spark**.

🤯 Anything about the space, time, physics and multiverse is another strong interest of mine.

🤩 Apart from work stuff, I love to travel, watch movies, anime and & play PC Games like **CS:Go**.
